            Exciting news on my continuing education journey - I’m learning to code! The inspiration came to me last fall as I was contemplating setting up a personal website, and, as often happens to me when I begin to research something, I was struck with the urge to learn how to make one myself. (Yes, I know I can just use Wordpress - but what would be the fun in that?!) I’m several months in at this point, and while I look forward to the day when I can create robust websites, in the meantime I have created this very simple website as a landing page for my design journaling, as well as to serve as a playground for my code learning. You may notice improvements over time, and I will play around with different formats to see what works.

         <p>   I have been “design journaling” in some fashion since the very      beginning of my career. This may be a surprise to my friends, as I am not known for being overly fond of writing. What I am quite fond of, though, is lifelong learning, and I have found that writing as a component of the educational process does not end with graduation. If anything, I have had to write considerably more throughout my career than was ever required for my college essays, simply to communicate my ideas. And the majority of what falls into my design journaling repertoire is a sort of narrative note-taking I have adopted to accompany textbook reading, the obtainment of formal certifications, or ongoing CEUs. My plan is to go back through my files to see what I think would be of use to anyone (or even what would make for enjoyable reading) and organize bits and pieces into full blog posts on a given topic.

        <p>    My particular interests in interior design are Universal Design+Aging in Place, sustainability, and continuing education/professional development. I have, however, found myself experiencing and therefore writing about the business side of design a fair amount as well - so that is what you can largely expect to find here. Feel free to email me with subjects you would like me to write about (or that I may have written about already), as I intend to keep building this project over time. I’m so excited to get my first website up and running, and I hope you enjoy!
